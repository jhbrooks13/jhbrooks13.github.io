### The only reliable assumption is that assumptions increase risk.
 —John H Brooks
<br><br><br>
This proverb encapsulates a universal fragility of problem-solving, learning, and everyday decisions: any assumption (however reasonable) is incomplete, misleading, and an opportunity to fail. It invites skepticism of mental shortcuts and avoidance of unexamined “facts”.

> Whether in design, engineering, science, philosophy, relationships, or everyday decisions, the message is the same: Assume at your own risk.
