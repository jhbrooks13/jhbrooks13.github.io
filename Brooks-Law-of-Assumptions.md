## Brooks’ Law of Assumptions:
### They’re always wrong.
 —John H Brooks
<br><br><br>
This principle is part philosophy, part hard-earned cynicism. It suggests that in any meaningful attempt to solve a problem, every assumption — no matter how innocent or “reasonable” — is destined to be flawed. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t make assumptions. It means we shouldn’t trust them.
Assumptions are mental shortcuts. They get us moving, keep us efficient, help us model the world in manageable fragments. But when it comes to problem-solving — especially under pressure, uncertainty, or scale — those shortcuts often send us off course. An assumption made but not examined becomes the quiet saboteur of good thinking.
This law isn’t about pessimism. It’s about intellectual discipline. It invites healthy doubt, rigorous questioning, and an almost philosophical humility. If you’re confident your assumptions are right, you’re probably not looking hard enough.
Whether in design, engineering, science, philosophy, relationships, or everyday decisions — the message is the same:
Assume at your own risk.
