# LEARN and IMPROVE

Most of us search for meaning; some find it in tradition, others by rejecting tradition entirely. Some draw strength from belonging to a group, while others are compelled to lead one. And then there are those of us who find our own way.
As I matured into independent thought, I came to realize that tradition held no intrinsic value for me, either to follow or to reject, and groups, at best, settled for compromise. That realization forced me to find my own way.
The summary of my soul-searching is that I have two purposes: to learn and to improve. I have distilled each purpose into a backronym of reminders within each category to keep key principles front of mind. I’ll share my logo and backronyms below. Inasmuch as they resonate with others, all are welcome to quote them for personal growth or improvement.

## My Purpose

### LEARN:
- **𝐋**ook macro and micro  
- **𝐄**valuate logically and socially  
- **𝐀**ccept facts, logic, and _dogs_  
- **𝐑**ecognize utility and beauty  
- **𝐍**urture mastery and insight  

### IMPROVE:
- **𝐈**nvigorate mind and body  
- **𝐌**aximize knowledge and justice  
- **𝐏**ropagate humanism and science  
- **𝐑**esolve issues and desires  
- **𝐎**versee exiles, orphans, and _dogs_  
- **𝐕**isualize scenarios and options  
- **𝐄**xplore new and unknown  

## Backronym Reminder Explanations

### LEARN:
-	**Look** macro and micro: A call to observe both the big picture and the fine details. Learning begins with seeing both.
-	**Evaluate** logically and socially: Learning isn’t just about cold logic; it’s also about understanding human context and relationships.
-	**Accept** facts, logic, and dogs: This is a reminder to accept the facts we learn, to accept the truths that can be uncovered through logical analysis, and to accept the reality that some creatures (like dogs) don’t always behave according to facts and logic.
-	**Recognize** utility and beauty: A reminder that knowledge isn’t just useful; it can also be inspiring and elegant.
-	**Nurture** mastery and insight: Learning isn’t passive; it’s a never-ending process that we cultivate over time, with care and intention.
### IMPROVE:
-	**Invigorate** mind and body: My goal “to improve” in general always includes a component of improving myself.
-	**Maximize** knowledge and justice: This is about taking positions and performing actions to help others improve their knowledge and help society be more just.
-	**Propagate** humanism and science: Beyond pushing knowledge and justice, this is about advocating to others about humanism and science to influence their paths.
-	**Resolve** issues and desires: This is the code function of solving problems in all their forms.
-	**Oversee** exiles, orphans, and dogs: Part of making improvements is supporting others (ideas) that have been rejected, have no other advocates, or lack the awareness of their needs.
-	**Visualize** scenarios and options: This is about both imagining how things could be better in anticipation of making improvements and imagining possible outcomes to be better prepared with ongoing responses.
-	**Explore** new and unknown: There is always more to learn and more opportunities for improvement. This is about avoiding complacency and continuing the purpose.

## The Symbols of Purpose
-	I define the Unicode character ⧊ as a symbol for learning: a Delta representing change, topped with a circle that could evoke a head, an eye, or conscious attention; each interpretation pointing toward the act of learning.
-	⨹ represents improvement: a Delta with a plus sign, suggesting not just change, but positive, intentional change.
-	As these symbols are rarely used and carry no fixed meaning, my appropriation of them avoids semantic collisions.
-	This combined glyph, my symbol for the lifelong commitment to learning and improving, serves as my compass and reminder.

> If these principles resonate, I invite you to make them your own—adopt them, remix them, or use them as a launchpad. The pursuit of learning and improvement is never proprietary.
