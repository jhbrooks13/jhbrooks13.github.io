# Government Intervention on Personal Medical Decisions

Everyone has their own opinions on how much the government should be involved in individual medical decisions and how much the government should issue mandates to limit people’s choices. This is not a dissertation about where that line should be drawn. It is, however, a dissertation about the importance of consistently enforcing the line once drawn.

## Personal Medical Decisions That Don’t Affect Others

It is generally accepted that people should have the right to make medical decisions on their own behalf when those decisions don’t affect others. Ideally, this is done in consultation with a qualified doctor with appropriate and relevant experience. Realistically, a patient who is insistent on a preferred medical treatment can always find a doctor willing to provide it.

## Personal Medical Decisions That Affect Others

My main topic is medical procedures that one person can choose that will affect another person. Specifically:
> **Under what circumstances should the government compel a person to undergo (or refrain from) a medical procedure to potentially save another person’s life?**

- It is estimated that about 4.5 million lives are saved each year from donated blood. A single pint of donated blood can save up to three lives. People who need a blood transfusion to live have a 0% survival chance without it. Blood donation has been common for over 100 years and there are only 31 cases of death attributed to this medical procedure. Blood donation generally has no cost to the donor and takes less than an hour including recovery. _Should the government compel people who are eligible to donate blood to make regular donations to save more lives?_
- Over 18,000 lives are saved each year in the USA alone by bone marrow transplants. The mortality risk of dying while donating a bone marrow is approximately 0.01%. Bone marrow donation is typically free and recovery is usually less than a week. _Should the government compel people who are a match to donate bone marrow to save more lives?_
- Over 25,000 lives are saved each year in the USA alone by kidney transplants. The mortality risk of dying while donating a kidney is approximately 0.01%. Kidney donation may be covered by donations but usually places many expenses on the donor. Recovery from kidney donation can take up to 6 weeks. _Should the government compel people who are a match to donate a kidney to save more lives?_
- Over 10,000 lives are saved each year in the USA alone by liver lobe transplant. People who need a liver transplant to live have a 0% survival chance without it. The mortality risk of dying while donating a liver lobe is approximately 0.1%. Liver lobe donation may be covered by donations but usually places many expenses on the donor. Recovery from liver lobe donation can take up to 12 weeks. _Should the government compel people who are a match to donate a portion of their liver to save more lives?_
- Over 4,000 lives are saved each year in the USA alone by heart transplant. People who need a heart transplant to live have a 0% survival chance without it. The mortality risk of dying while donating a heart is 100%. Donating a heart usually incurs no expenses to the donor. Recovery from a heart donation is not possible. _Should the government compel people who are a match to donate their heart to save more lives?_
- Delivering a full term baby is the traditional way to end a pregnancy. Removing the fetus from the uterus too early gives it a 0% chance of survival. The risk of dying while delivering a live baby is 0.033%. The risk of dying during a miscarriage is estimated to be about 0.003%. (The risk of mortality during abortion is 0.00045%.) The medical expense of pregnancy and delivery is currently about $15-25K in the USA (related expenses are not included in that number). In addition to the 9 months required to gestate a fetus, recovery from pregnancy can take from 8 weeks to over a year depending on many factors. _Should the government compel people to carry fetuses to term to create more babies?_

To a logical mind, these are all the same fundamental question with a few parameter variations. It is the question of one person potentially saving another person’s life at the risk of his/her own life.
The question and parameters can be generalized as the following thought-experiment. Imagine two lives: Person A and Person B.
- Person B has a serious condition, and his only chance of surviving is through a bodily donation from Person A. Without help from Person A, Person B has no (or negligible) chance of surviving.
- If Person A contributes to saving Person B, it will cost him T hours or days of immediate time, R hours or days or recovery time, and $C in real money out-of-pocket (each of these could also have compound loss of opportunity but that can’t be as easily quantified).
- If Person A contributes to saving Person B, it will carry a D% risk of death and a P% risk of permanent disability.
- If Person A contributes to saving Person B, Person B will gain S% chance of surviving.
<br><br>
Based on the thought experiment above, my original question can be more clearly stated:
> How much cost (money, time, opportunity) and personal risk (chance of death, chance of permanent disability) should the government **_force_** one person to undertake to improve another person’s chance of survival?

<br>
Any rational answer to that question will minimally include the six parameters above (T, R, D%, P%, $C, and S%). Every well-considered option could be documented in the following format:

'''
> The government should mandate that a person follows a specific medical plan (have or reject a medical procedure) when:
> - The plan will cost less than $C
> - The plan will require spending less than T time to complete
> - The recovery time after the plan is complete will take less than R time.
> - The plan carries less than D% chance of death.
> - The plan carries less than P% chance of permanent disability.
> - The plan increases the survival chances for the other person by at least S%.
'''

Any policy that mandates a medical path without addressing all six parameters or carves out special treatment for specific procedures is intellectually indefensible and ethically reckless.
